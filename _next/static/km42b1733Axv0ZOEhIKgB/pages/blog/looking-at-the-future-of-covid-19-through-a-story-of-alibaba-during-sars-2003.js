It was also in May of this year that Alibaba was requested to go into full quarantine due to the summer SARS epidemic.\nIt was during this quarantine period, that we launched Taobao. I remember the most eye-catching spot on the website homepage wrote: "For the entrepreneurs who kept going in the most difficult of times, for those who worked hard during the SARS."

However, because of the overwhelming coverage of SARS in the national and even international media, this small company became recognizable by everyone in the world.\nI remember when in the past most people had never heard of Alibaba. After "SARS", everyone knew Alibaba. We no longer needed to do any advertising. The company marvelously seized this opportunity, one example is with the launch of a large-scale campaign called "Alibaba joins millions of businessmen in fight against SARS." Once a quiet company, achieved a lot in PR, especially with the launch of Alibaba Platform\'s advertisement on CCTV (China\'s TV channel) to promote online shopping. Reputation and the brand were established overnight.'),b("p",null,"Secondly, for the teams, the friendship between our colleagues evolved after overcoming all the difficulties.

Customers would say amazing things to us, like how we worked even from home, and that even the SARS did not stop us. A client said to me: "Bro, when you called me about the contract, were you already quarantined by that time?" I said, "Yes, but I didn\'t dare to tell you at that time." He looked at me with admiration: "I must sign this order with you today, and I have to tell all my friends to do business with Alibaba. For what you have done this time, I can say your company can be trusted, and your team can also be trusted. You take responsibility, the money I paid to you is worth it!"'),b("p",null,'From 2001 to 2002, for a long period of time, the business demand activity was stuck at around 3,000 posts per day. After the "SARS", we started adding 3,500 new members every day, doubling from the previous quarter. A large number of old members have also begun to increase the frequency of online transactions. There is data that showed that new business posts at that time reached 9,000 to 12,000. The feedback in international buyers\'s business also doubled compared to the previous quarter. The whole website reached nearly 200 million visits per month, with more than 2.4 million buy-sell inquiries. There were 380,000 professional buyers and 1.9 million members from all over the world are looking for business opportunities and conducting various transactions through Alibaba.

It was at this time when people began to have broadband connection and began to experience that they can do a lot at home. It can be said that precisely because of "SARS", many businessmen began to explore new business opportunities in the Internet and e-commerce, and that is also how many buyers started to look for new ways to find things online.
